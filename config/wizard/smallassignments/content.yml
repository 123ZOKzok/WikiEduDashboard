        content: |
          <ul>
            <li>Review pages 4-7 of the Evaluating Wikipedia brochure. This will give you a good, brief overview of what to look for in other articles, and what other people will look for in your own.</li>
            <li>Evaluate an existing Wikipedia article related to the class, and leave suggestions for improving it on the article's talk page.</li>
            <li>A few questions to consider (don't feel limited to these):
            <ul><li>Is each fact referenced with an appropriate, reliable reference?</li>
            <li>Is everything in the article relevant to the article topic? Is there anything that distracted you?</li>
            <li>Is the article neutral? Are there any claims, or frames, that appear heavily biased toward a particular position?</li>
            <li>Where does the information come from? Are these neutral sources? If biased, is that bias noted?</li>
            <li>Are there viewpoints that are overrepresented, or underrepresented?</li>
            <li>Check a few citations. Do the links work? Is there any close paraphrasing or plagiarism in the article?</li>
            <li>Is any information out of date? Is anything missing that could be added?</li></ul></li>
