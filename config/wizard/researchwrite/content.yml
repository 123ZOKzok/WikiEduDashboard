          <p>
            Welcome to your Wikipedia project's course timeline. This page will
            guide you through the Wikipedia project for your course. Be sure to
            check with your instructor to see if there are other pages you should
            be following as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            This page breaks down writing a Wikipedia article into a series of
            steps, or milestones. These steps include online trainings to help
            you get started on Wikipedia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your course has also been assigned a Wikipedia Content Expert. Check
            your Talk page for notes from them. You can also reach them through
            the "<strong>Get Help</strong>" button on this page.
          </p>
          <p>
            To get started, please review the following handouts:

            It's time to think critically about Wikipedia articles. You'll
            evaluate a Wikipedia article, and leave suggestions for improving it
            on the article's Talk page.

              <ul>
                <li>Is each fact referenced with an appropriate, reliable reference?</li>
                <li>Is everything in the article relevant to the article topic? Is there anything that distracted you?</li>
                <li>Is the article neutral? Are there any claims, or frames, that appear heavily biased toward a particular position?</li>
                <li>Where does the information come from? Are these neutral sources? If biased, is that bias noted?</li>
                <li>Are there viewpoints that are overrepresented, or underrepresented?</li>
                <li>Check a few citations. Do the links work? Is there any close paraphrasing or plagiarism in the article?</li>
                <li>Is any information out of date? Is anything missing that could be added?</li>

            Now that you're thinking about what makes a "good" Wikipedia article,
            consider some additional questions.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Wikipedians often talk about "content gaps." What do you think a content gap is, and what are ways to see where they appear?</li>
            <li>What are some reasons a content gap might arise? What are some ways to remedy them?</li>
            <li>Does it matter who writes Wikipedia?</li>
            <li>What does it mean to be "unbiased" on Wikipedia? How is that different, or similar, to your own definition of "bias"?</li>

              Before you start, review the <a href="http://wikiedu.org/illustratingwikipedia">Illustrating Wikipedia</a> handbook,
              or see <a href="http://wikiedu.org/editingwikipedia">Editing Wikipedia</a> pages 10–11.

            <li>When you've reviewed those pages, take the training linked below.</li>
            <li>
              When you're ready to start finding images, remember: <strong>Never</strong>
              grab images you find through an image search, or those found on
              Instagram, Tumblr, Reddit, Imgur, or even so-called "Free image" or
              "free stock photo" websites. Instead, you'll want to find images
              with clear proof that the creator has given permission to use their
              work. Many of these images can be found on
              <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org/">search.creativecommons.org</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
               Don't just upload an image to Wikipedia. Instead, upload it to
               Wikipedia's sister site for images, Wikimedia Commons. For
               instructions, read through the <a href="http://wikiedu.org/illustratingwikipedia">Illustrating Wikipedia</a> handbook.

              Write an outline of that topic in the form

                  A "lead" section is not a traditional introduction. It should
                  summarize, very briefly, what the rest of the article will say
                  in detail. The first paragraph should include important, broad

              Select three classmates’ articles that you will peer review and copyedit.
              On the <strong>Articles</strong> tab, find the articles that you want

              Peer review your classmates' drafts. Leave suggestions on on the
              Talk page of the article, or sandbox, that your fellow student is
              working on. Other editors may be reviewing your work, so look for
              their comments! Be sure to acknowledge feedback from other Wikipedians.

          <p>
            Once you've made improvements to your article based on peer review
            feedback, it's time to move your work to Wikipedia proper - the "mainspace."
          </p>
          <p><strong>Editing an existing article?</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>NEVER copy and paste your draft of an article over the entire article. Instead, edit small sections at a time.</li>
            <li>Copy your edits into the article. Make many small edits, saving each time, and leaving an edit summary. Never replace more than one to two sentences without saving!</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Creating a new article?</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Read <a href="http://wikiedu.org/editingwikipedia">Editing Wikipedia</a> page 13, and follow those steps to move your article from your Sandbox to Mainspace.</li>
            <li>You can also review the <a href="../../../training/students/sandboxes">Sandboxes and Mainspace</a> online training.</li>

            <li>Optional: For new articles or qualifying expansions of stubs, compose a one-sentence “hook,” nominate it for “Did you know,” (see the DYK instructions handout) and monitor the nomination for any issues identified by other editors. Wiki Education Foundation staff can provide support for this process.</li>
