# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      The total amount of content a user has added to Wikipedia articles,
      calculated by adding up the size increases for every edit the user
      made that added net content. This offers a rough indication of how
      much they contributed to Wikipedia. This number may be misleadingly
      large if the user added the same content multiple time after someone
      else removed it, or if the user accidentally removed existing content
      and then restored it.
