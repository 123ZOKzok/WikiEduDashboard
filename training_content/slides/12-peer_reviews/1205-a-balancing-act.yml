title: A balancing act
summary:
content: |
  Wikipedia articles are summaries of pre-existing resources. They should be
  balanced according to the available literature. No aspect should take over too
  much of the article, and more well-documented viewpoints should get more
  space. However, a good article also presents minority viewpoints and
  positions.

  * Is each section's length equal to its importance to the article's subject?
  Are there sections in the article that seem unnecessary? Is anything
  off-topic?
  * Does the article reflect all the perspectives represented in the published
  literature? Are any significant viewpoints left out or missing?
