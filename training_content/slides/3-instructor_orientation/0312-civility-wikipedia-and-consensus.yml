title: "Civility: Wikipedia and consensus"
summary:
content: >
  On Wikipedia, editorial decisions, and even core policies, are determined through consensus. 
  It's not a matter of voting, and nobody is "in charge" over a final say. 


  When disagreements occur, they can best be resolved through discussion —
  usually on the relevant Talk page. Since Wikipedia articles should be written
  from a neutral point of view — fairly describing significant viewpoints on a
  subject without endorsing any of them — it is usually possible to reach a
  point where both sides believe their position is described accurately.
