  Let's review a few common types of Wikipedia assignments. Of course, you
  can adjust and adapt the course assignment from how itâ€™s described here.


  We'll look at:


  Some broader assignments:

  * Creating or expanding an article

  * Translating an article

  * Adding images, video, or illustrations to Wikipedia

  * Copyediting


  Some quicker assignments:

  * Adding small amounts of content (ie, a single sentence)

  * Critiquing an article (and its longer counterpart, critiquing while writing)
