summary:
content: >
  Wikipedia can be a great source for developing critical reading and evaluation
  skills.


  **Evaluate an article:** An exercise in critical reading and media literacy. 
  Assign students to read an article and assess its quality in a stand-alone paper
  or class presentation. Students may be  encouraged to contribute critiques to 
  the Talk page of an article. This assignment does not involve writing or research.


  **Knowledge construction:** When evaluation is combined with writing an article, 
  this assignment can present unique opportunities to examine broader questions of
  "consensus" and "neutrality" on Wikipedia. Students perform a literature review in
  a given topic, then compare their findings to Wikipedia. They focus on content 
  missing from Wikipedia and examine the absence as a critique of systemic bias. 
  In the meantime, students contribute the content that's missing.
