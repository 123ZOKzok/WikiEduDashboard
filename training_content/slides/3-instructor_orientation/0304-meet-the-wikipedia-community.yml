title: Meet Wikipediaâ€™s community
summary:
content: |
  The English Wikipedia has about 30,000 active editors, or
  "Wikipedians." 
  
  It ranges from:
  * niche editors who build articles in a particular subject area
  * "WikiGnomes" who work quietly formatting pages
  * vandal fighters who fix bad edits
  * reviewers who help run Wikipedia's peer-review processes
  * administrators who clean up messes and block disruptive editors
  * policy wonks who analyze how Wikipedia works and discuss ways to improve it
  
  And, finally: You and your students. Whenever you contribute to Wikipedia, you're a Wikipedian, too. 

  What we have in common is a passion for Wikipedia. Although we come from
  different perspectives (and often disagree!), we're here to make Wikipedia
  better.
