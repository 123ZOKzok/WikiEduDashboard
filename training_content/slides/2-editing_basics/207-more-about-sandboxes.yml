title: Sandboxes (continued)
summary:
content: |
  If you're enrolled in a course on this dashboard, then your sandbox page was
  automatically set up. Later on, you can use a sandbox (you can create as many
  as you need) to work on content for Wikipedia.

  It's also handy to leave the section at the top — a *template* — that says
  "this is a user sandbox". In "Edit source" mode, you can see the wiki code for
  that template, something like `{{student sandbox}}`.
