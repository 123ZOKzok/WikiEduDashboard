title: "'Edit' vs 'Edit source'"
summary:
content: |
  Wikipedia gives you two options for editing. The "Edit" option opens
  VisualEditor, which lets you edit the text on the screen just as it appears on
  the page. The "Edit source" option lets you see the underlying WikiCode.

  VisualEditor makes it easy to add text, cite sources, create links, and
  do basic formatting. However, it is only available for articles. To talk 
  to other Wikipedians, you'll use WikiCode. 

  Please check Wikipedia right now, and make sure you see both the "Edit" and
  "Edit source" options when you look at an article.

  If you see "Edit source", as shown above, go on to the next slide.

  If you do **not** see "Edit source" option, then follow these steps to make sure
  you have the VisualEditor enabled:
  * Make sure you are logged into your Wikipedia account.
  * Click on "Preferences".
  * Click on the "Edit" tab.
  * Make sure to uncheck the box "Temporarily disable the visual editor while it
  is in beta."
  * Click "Save".
  * At this point, when you load a Wikipedia article, you should see both the
  "Edit" and "Edit source" options.
