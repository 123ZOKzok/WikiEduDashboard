  Behind every great Wikipedia article is a community of volunteers working
  together to make it great. These editors coordinate their improvements through
  a Talk page.

  The Talk page is where conversations about the article take place. Before you
  edit an existing article, take a look at the page to get a sense of the issues
  and discussions that have already taken place. This is a good place to
  introduce yourself (don't use your real name, though your course name is OK to
  share) and your plans to improve the article. Share the sources you want to
  use, and ask questions if you have them. Wikipedians with an interest in the
  topic will often take note and try to help. It's nice to post things in
  advance of making your edits, but you don't have to wait for "permission" to
  make a change. Remember: Be bold!

  Wikipedians assume you'll be reading messages left in your user Talk page and
  article Talk pages. You can use these pages to leave messages for others, too.
