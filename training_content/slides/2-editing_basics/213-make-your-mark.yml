  Once you've made your edit, look for the blue "Save page" button in VisualEditor,
  or the gray "Save page" button in WikiCode.

  For both, you'll want to edit what's called an "Edit summary." This is a brief
  description of what you just did, so other editors can make sense of your
  edits. For example, if you added a citation, you would write "added citation."
  If you copyedited or fixed a grammatical mistake, you could write "c/e" for
  copyedit. (There's no real "official shorthand," just make sure you convey the
  intent of the action you took when you edited the page).
  
  In VisualEditor, you'll be asked for your edit summary after you save your edit. In
  WikiCode, you'll want to type your edit before you save.
