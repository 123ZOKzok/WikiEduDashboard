title: Edit an existing article
summary:
content: |
  If you're editing an existing article, a sandbox can be a good place to copy
  and paste a few sentences or a paragraph to develop. Don't copy and paste the
  entire article into your sandbox, however.

  Instead, copy the paragraph or sentences you want to work with back into the
  article, and then save the change.

  If you're working with a new article that you've created, and doesn't exist on
  Wikipedia already, you can "move" your sandbox page into mainspace. In the
  next slides, we'll show you how.
