title: Move out of the sandbox
summary:
content: |
  With a good title in mind, you're ready to start moving.

  1. Go to your sandbox (the "Sandbox" link in the upper right corner, by your
  username).
  2. On the sandbox page (where your article is), look to the right. To the left
  of your search bar is a tab called "More." Click it, and then click "Move."

  A new page will appear.
