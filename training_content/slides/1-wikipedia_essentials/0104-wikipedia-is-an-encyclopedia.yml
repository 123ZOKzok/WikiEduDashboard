  **Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia.**

  OK, maybe this seems obvious. But it be more helpful to think about it as
  telling you what Wikipedia is NOT.

  It’s not an advertising platform, a personal website, an experiment in anarchy
  or democracy, an collection of random data, or a web directory.

  It’s not a dictionary, a newspaper, a book or instruction manual, or a
  collection of found documents.
