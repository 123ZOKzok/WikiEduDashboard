  **Editors should interact with each other in a respectful and civil manner.**

  Don't panic if someone else edits your work, or removes your contributions.

  Every article has a Talk page where you can interact with the other editors
  who are working on your article. If you have a disagreement, keep some core
  Wikipedia values in mind:

  * Respect and be polite to your fellow Wikipedians, even when you disagree.
  * Avoid personal attacks. Talk to people you disagree with, and try to find
  consensus.
  * If you don’t agree with someone’s edit, don’t just “change it back.” That’s
  an edit war, and it could get you both blocked! If you have a persistent disagreement, talk to your instructor or the Wikipedia Content Expert assigned to your course. They’ll help you get it fixed.
  * Act in good faith. Never disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point.

  Being respectful isn’t limited to disagreements. Being polite means responding
  to messages left by other editors, thank people who help, and check back after
  your edits to see if anyone has responded. Always be mindful of the community
  around you.
