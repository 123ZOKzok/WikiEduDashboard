title: Upload a file
summary:
content: |
  Now that you know the types of materials you can share on Commons, let's look
  at how you can upload your work.

  To upload a media file, first go to commons.wikimedia.org, and make sure you
  are logged in. Click "upload file" on the right hand side of the page.

  You'll see an introduction text. Read it and click "Next" at the bottom right.

  Then, find the image you want to upload. A small text will open, asking
  whether the file is your own work, or someone else's. If it's your work, enter
  your username (you don't have to use your real name). If the image belongs to
  someone else, name the author and where you found the image, and select the
  copyright status of the work. Click "next."
