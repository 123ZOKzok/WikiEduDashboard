        "I released my photo under a free license, so I gave up my copyright."
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! You still have the right to control the use of your work for
        purposes that aren't covered by the free license.

        "I took a photo of this copyrighted work myself, so it's my own copyright."
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! Photographs of other copyrighted works don't fall under your
        own copyright. A photograph is still a copy - and you don't have the
        copyright of the image you just copied!

        "I scanned this copyrighted work, so it's my copyright."
      explanation: |
        INCORRECT! Scans of copyrighted work don't fall under your own
        copyright. It's a copy - and you don't have the right to make that copy!
        (Hence, "copyright"!)

        "I shared this image using a free license, but I am still the copyright holder."
      explanation: |
        CORRECT! You still maintain the copyright for your work. However, you
        can revoke that right from anyone who uses it when you've shared it
        under a free license. You do, however, have the right to decide how your
        work is used in contexts outside your free license.
