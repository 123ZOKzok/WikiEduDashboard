title: "How do you use images elsewhere?"
summary:
content: |
  The works on Commons aren't exclusively for Wikipedia. You can use your
  Commons images on other projects, too.

  Make sure to check the copyright restrictions on the image you want to use.
  Most will specify requirements for using the image, such as linking back to
  the source and giving proper attribution (credit) to the person who created
  the work. Some won't have any restrictions at all.
