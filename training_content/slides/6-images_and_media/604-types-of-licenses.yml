  You can use a few different types of free licenses on Commons.

  * CC BY-SA: This means it's an "Attribution-ShareAlike" license.
  * CC BY: This means you want to get credit for work, including remixes and
  modifications, but you don't care if the new work is shared under the same
  license.
  * CC ZERO: This means you release your work with no restrictions whatsoever.
  They can modify, reuse, and sell the work without giving you credit or
  following a similar license.

  It's important to remember that there are no restrictions on others using your
  work for any purpose. Be clear that when you share your work on Commons, you
  can't specify it as noncommercial. That helps this information become as
  widely used as possible by encouraging artists, publishers, and others to use
  these resources in works that they might sell. However, by including the
  CC BY-SA attribution, you will ensure that anyone shares your work with the
  same terms, which will reduce commercial exploitation of your work.
