  Remember that just because everything on Wikipedia is free to use, that
  doesn't mean everything you put on Wikipedia becomes free to use. Copyrighted
  materials, including lengthy passages from books, illustrations, and
  photographs, don't belong on Wikipedia. This is true even if you cite the
  material and give proper credit to the author.

  The exception is for work in the public domain (very old works), or works
  which were released to the public by the author under a free license. In each
  case, you must make sure to cite the source of the information, and to show
  where the author has released it under a free license (that is, link directly
  to the license).

  Note, however, that lengthy quotations usually aren't appropriate, anyway.
  It's best to paraphrase the information into your own words.
