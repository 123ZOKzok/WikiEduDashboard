  You can also use the *Cite* gadget to insert the `<ref>` tags and citation
  details.

  1. Click "Cite" in the toolbar at the top of the edit window.
  2. Position the cursor where you want to add a citation.
  3. Click the Templates pulldown, then selection the type of source: general
  webpage, news article, book, or journal article.
  4. Fill out the details of the source.
  5. Click "Insert".

  If you enter a Ref name, you can reuse the same citation elsewhere in the
  article without needing to re-enter the details. Click "Named references" to
  re-use a citation that includes a Ref name.
