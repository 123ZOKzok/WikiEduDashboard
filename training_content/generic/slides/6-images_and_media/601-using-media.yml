title: Using media
summary:
content: |
  Wikipedia articles aren't just text. There's also video, photographs, and
  illustrations.

  Usually, that stuff lives on Wikimedia Commons. Commons is one of the largest
  collections of media files in the world, with millions of images. All of these
  images are under a "free license," which means you (and anyone else) can share
  them. You just have to follow certain rules.

  This orientation will help you get started using and sharing media on
  Wikimedia Commons.
