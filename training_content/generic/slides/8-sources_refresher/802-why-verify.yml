title: Why verify?
summary:
content: |
  Behind every great Wikipedia article is a collection of great sources. One of
  the first things you should do, even before you choose a topic to write about,
  is create a collection of good sources.

  You shouldn’t trust everything you read on the internet, and Wikipedia is no
  different. You can see where facts come from at the end of the article. That
  helps anyone verify facts to make sure that they’re true.

  When you add content to Wikipedia, you’ll want to be sure that people can
  check out your sources of information, too.

  So, make sure you only share facts from reliable sources. Reliable sources
  include:

  * Textbooks
  * Literature reviews
  * Books or publications written by experts in the field, and published by
  reliable publishers.

  Do not use:

  * Blog posts
  * Press materials intended to show something in a certain light

  In some cases, such as articles that involve medical editing, newspapers and
  pop-press articles aren’t appropriate, either! (If that applies to you, be
  sure to check out our module on editing for Medical information).
