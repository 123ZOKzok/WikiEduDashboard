  So, how do you decide if your source is suitable for Wikipedia?

  Information on Wikipedia must:

  * Come from independent sources, that is, those not directly related to the subject.
  * Come from sources known for fact-checking and neutrality, such as academic
  presses, peer-reviewed journals, or international newspapers.
  * Come from reliable publishers, and represent a general consensus in the
  field (including significant minority points of view).
