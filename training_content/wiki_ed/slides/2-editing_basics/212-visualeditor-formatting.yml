  To format text in VisualEditor, click the "A" button, highlight your text, and
  choose the best option.

  * The "Bold" item (B) bolds the selected text.
  * The "Italic" item (I) italicizes the selected text.
  * The "Superscript" item (x2) causes the selected text to appear smaller than
  surrounding text and to be slightly higher than the surrounding text.
  * The "Subscript" item (x2) causes the selected text to appear smaller than
  surrounding text and slightly lower than the surrounding text.
  * The "Strikethrough" item (S) adds a solid bar through the selected text.
  * The "Computer code" item (a set of curly brackets: {}) changes the font of
  the selected text to a monospaced font, which sets it apart from surrounding
  (proportionally spaced) text.
  * The "Underline" item (U) adds a solid line beneath the selected text.
  * The "Language" item (A„ÅÇ) allows you to label the language (for example,
  Japanese) and direction (for example, right-to-left) of the selected text.
  * The final item, "Clear styling", removes all character formatting from the
  selected text, including links.

  If you have not selected any text, then when you click the "A" to open the
  menu, and then select an item, that formatting will apply to the text that you
  start typing, from wherever your cursor is located.
