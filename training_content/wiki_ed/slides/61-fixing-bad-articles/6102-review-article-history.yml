content: |
  Looking at the edit history of a bad article can give important
  context for how to go about fixing it. From the live article on
  Wikipedia, click, "View history" at the upper right.

  The history page shows the timestamp of each edit, the username
  of the editor, the size of the article and how much it changed by,
  and the edit summary that (ideally) describes what was changed.

  The history lets you view older versions and to see what changed
  between different versions. Click a timestamp to view the article
  at that point. Click **prev** to compare that version to the one
  immediately previous, which shows exactly what was changed in that
  single edit. Click **cur** to see cumulative changes between that
  version and the current one. You can also select any two versions
  and then click **Compare selected revisions** to see what changed
  between them.

  Have all the recent edits come from students, or have other
  editors been active on the article as well?
