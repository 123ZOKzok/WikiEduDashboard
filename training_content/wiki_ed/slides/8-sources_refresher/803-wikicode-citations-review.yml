  How do you let other editors verify your information?

  If it's a new article, add a References section to the article using WikiCode.

  You can access WikiCode through the "Edit source" option on the page.

  Then, follow these instructions:
  1. Check that the bottom of the page has a "Notes" or "References" section. If
  not, type:  `==Notes==`.
  2. Check that the Notes section either has the text `{{reflist}}` or
  `<references />`. If not, type: `{{reflist}}`. This determines where your
  references will appear on the page.
  3. Now click after the text you would like to create a reference for.
  4. Now type in the `<ref>` tag before your reference and type `</ref>` after
  your reference. Wiki software will automatically add your inline reference
  number.
