title: "Evaluating the reviews"
content: |
  1. Peruse 2-3 of the following systematic reviews and familiarize yourself with the
  types of content they cover. The reviews are lengthy, so you may wish to only
  review small sections.

  2. Navigate to Wikipedia and read one or more corresponding articles (or the relevant sections of articles) to see how those topics are covered.

  3. When you find existing Wikipedia coverage that matches what the review discusses, use the review to fact-check the Wikipedia content.
  If the Wikipedia content is consistent with the review, look at the sources (if any) that Wikipedia currently cites for that content.
  What kinds of sources are they? Primary research? A report that summarizes only a few studies? An older systematic review?

  4. If citing the PCORI review would improve the article's sourcing, it's time to add that citation. You may also wish to add a sentence or two to the
  article if there is relevant information in the systematic review not yet covered on Wikipedia.
