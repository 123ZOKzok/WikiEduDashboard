  If you're an instructor at an institution of higher education in the U.S. and Canada
  and you'd like to run a Wikipedia assignment, then you're in the right place. 

  To join our program for the Fall 2020 term, you will first need to complete this
  orientation and then create a course page on our Course Dashboard by August 1, 2020.
  We will notify you by August 15, 2020, whether we have a spot for you in our Fall term cohort.
  All applications received after August 1, will be considered on a rolling basis and may not
  be considered if we have already reached capacity. If you are running a Wikipedia assignment
  during Summer 2020 or another future term, you should proceed and follow the steps
  outlined in this orientation. 

  If you're outside of the U.S. or Canada, or outside of higher education, the independent
  Wikimedia Foundation education team can help you find local resources to
  support your project. In that case, you can create a course page using the Programs & Events
  Dashboard (<a href="https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org">outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org</a>).
