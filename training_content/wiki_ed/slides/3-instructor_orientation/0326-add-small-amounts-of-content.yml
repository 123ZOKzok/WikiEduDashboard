  This approach can provide an overview of research methods while
  introducing students to Wikipedia. Students find, or are assigned, an article
  topic. They then conduct research for small bits of information that arenâ€™t
  included in the current Wikipedia article. They track their research and post the
  information, citing it to the source. The information can be anything from a
  sentence to a paragraph long.
