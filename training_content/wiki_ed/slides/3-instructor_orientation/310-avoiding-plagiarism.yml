title: Avoiding plagiarism
summary:
content: |
  Students plagiarize. However, the intent is rarely to be malicious.
  Plagiarism happens because students don't know how to avoid it when navigating
  too much information. An inability to “say it in their own words” often leads
  to plagiarism. We encourage you to explicitly address plagiarism in your courses,
  but not solely in punitive terms. Modeling paraphrasing and developing writing
  strategies for summarizing material offer some ways to help students avoid
  plagiarism and improve their writing skills simultaneously.

  Fortunately, Wikipedia has standards and practices in place to delete plagiarism
  and close paraphrasing. Students need to ensure that their hard work won’t get
  removed or they could face being banned. They should handle sources very
  carefully by using their sandbox to keep track of where they find are discovering
  knowledge about their topic. Utilizing an organized system of logging sources
  that will enable them to quickly differentiate between their own writing and
  that of their sources, as well as peer reviewing, can help guarantee that the
  content is in their own words. 

  ### Additional resources
  * Wiki Education has created a required [Plagiarism and Copyright Violation
  training module](/training/students/plagiarism) that students will complete.
  * Wikipedia has tools that continuously monitor for suspected plagiarism.
  Wiki Education staff review plagiarism reports daily, delete any plagiarism or
  close paraphrasing, and post warnings to students to help them understand how
  to avoid this.
  * Repeat offenders will receive a second warning and notification that another
  editor may block them temporarily. At this point, Wiki Education staff will
  notify you, link to relevant plagiarism reports, and ask you to remind
  students how important it is to write in their own words. It's up to you
  whether to follow any university protocol regarding plagiarism.
