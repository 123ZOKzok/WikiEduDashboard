title: Finding articles for students to work on
summary:
content: |
  Before you begin your Wikipedia assignment, you might decide to prepare a list
  of articles your students can work on.

  To help you find promising articles for your students to improve (or create),
  we've created a short side path to this orientation. It explores how to find
  articles that Wikipedians have identified as needing improvement or creation.
  You can take that (10-minute) side path by clicking the green button below.
  The module will open in a new tab, and you can continue from here when you
  reach the end. If you're not interested right now, you can always find this
  segment of the training listed on your orientation dashboard.
