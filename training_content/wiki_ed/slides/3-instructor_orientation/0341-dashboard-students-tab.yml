  The **Students** tab features a table of students with:
  * Wikipedia username (and real name, which you can see but others cannot)
  * assigned article(s)
  * article(s) of other students that theyâ€™re peer-reviewing
  * number of edits in the previous 7 days
  * amount of content added to Mainspace (ie, live articles) and to Userspace (sandboxes or user pages)

  You can also zoom in on an individual student to see more details, including:
  * their progress in the online trainings
  * a list of their most recent Wikipedia edits

  If you need to add or remove students, you can do so through the "Enrollment"
  button on the Students tab.
