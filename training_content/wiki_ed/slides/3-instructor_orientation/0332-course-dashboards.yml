  Your course Dashboard is designed to facilitate your Wikipedia assignment from
  beginning to end. You'll begin by creating a timeline for your course with our
  assignment design tool. The timeline will not replace the syllabus for your
  course, but will provide your students with a series of weekly milestones to
  prepare them for each stage of the editing process, along with relevant
  trainings and resources. You will use the Dashboard to track the work that
  your students do on Wikipedia, from assigning articles to peer reviews.
