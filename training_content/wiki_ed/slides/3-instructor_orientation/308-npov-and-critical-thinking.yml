content: |
  Both students and instructors in our Classroom Program value Wikipedia
  assignments for teaching critical thinking skills more than traditional
  coursework.

  As students navigate Wikipedia's neutrality requirements, they cultivate these
  skills. They must:
  * determine which sources are most authoritative, considering publishers,
  format, date of publication, and author bias
  * weigh competing claims within the texts they read
  * accurately describe differing viewpoints and their significance, without
  giving undue weight to one particular viewpoint

  Students present facts so readers can form their own judgment. By producing
  knowledge in this manner, they learn how to consume knowledge in the same way,
  thus developing critical thinking skills.
