  We're about to start your introduction to teaching with Wikipedia. But first,
  we want to make sure you're in the right place.

  **If you teach in a higher education classroom in the United States or Canada,
  please proceed!**

  If you're teaching *outside of the U.S. or Canada*, or *outside of higher
  education*, the independent Wikimedia Foundation education team can help you
  find local resources. You can create your course page using the Programs &
  Events Dashboard (<a href="https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org">outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org</a>).
  You can reach the Wikimedia team at <a href="mailto:education@wikimedia.org">education@wikimedia.org</a>.
