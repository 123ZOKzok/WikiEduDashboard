  Once your course is underway, youâ€™ll be assigned a Wiki Education staff member
  (a "Wikipedia Expert") who provides Wikipedia know-how during the assignment.

  Wiki Education is dedicated to intervening with students who encounter problems
  and challenges on Wikipedia. That said, we're a small nonprofit organization,
  and each Wikipedia Expert supports more than 3,000 students at once. We're able
  to provide high-quality, timely support thanks to the tools we've built into the
  Wiki Education Dashboard, which is why we can only offer staff support to courses
  officially participating in the Student Program. Here's what you can expect from
  your Wikipedia Expert:

  * Students and instructors may reach out to their Wikipedia Expert regarding student
  work, Wikipedia policy, and interactions with other members of the Wikipedia editing
  community. Before reaching out to your Wikipedia Expert, instructors and students
  should consult Wiki Education's robust resources.
  * If asked to do so by the instructor, the Wikipedia Expert will provide feedback on
  student work. Requests should be made by the instructor and should point to specific
  pages (sandboxes or article-space edits), and should include the date by which the
  reviews are needed. Depending on their current workload, the Wikipedia Expert will
  respond to let you know if they can fulfill the request in the time needed. Please
  note that November/December and April/May are busy periods and our ability to
  provide reviews in these periods is more limited.
  * Your Wikipedia Expert may make minor changes to student work while in their sandbox,
  and may make more substantial edits once moved into the article main space. In
  all cases, these edits are made to help the article conform with Wikipedia policy.
