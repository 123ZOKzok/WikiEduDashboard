  The **Articles** tab has three sections: Articles Edited, Assigned Articles,
  and Available Articles.

  The **Articles Edited** table shows every live Wikipedia article your students
  have edited, along with how much content they added and how many page
  views the article has had since students started editing.

  Zoom in on an article for some additional tools: the Diff Viewer that
  shows you the cumulative changes to the article from the students' first edit
  to their last, and a graph of the "Structural Completeness" of the article
  over time.

  The **Assigned Articles** table shows which student(s) are working on and
  reviewing which article(s). You can use this to make sure every article has
  reviewers, and to see which students are collaborating on the same article.

  The **Available Articles** table gives you the option of creating a list of
  good topics for students to work on. When a student chooses one of the
  Available Articles, it is removed from the list.
