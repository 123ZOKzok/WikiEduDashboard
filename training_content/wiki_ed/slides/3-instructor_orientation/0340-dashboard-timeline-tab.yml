  The **Timeline** tab has a complete list of relevant Wikipedia-based
  milestones for your assignment. You can edit these segments to incorporate
  your own course activities or reading if you'd like to make this a one-stop
  resource for students. Whether you use it for all course activities or only
  the Wikipedia portion of the course is up to you.

  The timeline is divided into weeks, based on the dates and holidays you enter
  for your course, with blocks representing individual assignments or activities
  â€” including training modules that you can assign to your students. You'll be
  able to edit, rearrange, add or remove timeline activities at any time.
