  through this orientation and created and submitted a Dashboard course page. You will be
  prompted to create your course page at the end of this orientation.

  We will notify you by August 7, 2020 if we are able to offer you a spot for the Fall 2020
  term. To read more about our procedures for the Fall term, [click here](https://wikiedu.org/blog/2020/06/24/new-application-process-for-student-program-in-fall-2020-term/).

  If you submit your application after July 26, we will review your submission if there is
  still space available.

  If you're submitting an application for Summer 2020 or another academic term, the above
  deadlines do not apply.
