title: The challenges of editing medical topics
summary:
content: |
  Wikipedia is one of the leading websites people turn to for medical
  information, more so than websites from the National Institute of Health,
  World Health Organization, or WebMD.

  Poor information about on medical topics can have real-world consequences for
  readers who don't always bring the amount of skepticism they should to
  Wikipedia's health information.

  That's why Wikipedia has strict standards for editing content about medicine
  and psychology, which can make it challenging for student editors to
  contribute. MEDRS is short for "Medical Reliable Sources," and it's the set of
  guidelines for identifying reliable sources in medicine.

  This orientation will give you an overview of those requirements, which are
  always available in detail by using typing the Wikipedia shortcut `WP:MEDRS`
  into the search bar on Wikipedia.
