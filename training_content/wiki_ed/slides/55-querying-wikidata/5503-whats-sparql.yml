title: "What's SPARQL?"
summary:
content: |
  Wikidata uses a query language called SPARQL (pronounced "sparkle"). SPARQL
  queries allow you to ask very specific questions about information included
  in Wikidata, and to tap into Wikidata's repository of structure, linked data.
  **SPARQL** stands for "a protocol and RDF query language," which is what
  SPARQL is.
