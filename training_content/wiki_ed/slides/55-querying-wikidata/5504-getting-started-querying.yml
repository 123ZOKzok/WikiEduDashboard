title: "Getting started"
summary:
content: |
  To get started, open a link to <a href="https://query.wikidata.org/">Wikidata's Query Service</a>
  in a separate browser tab. During this training,
  it's best if you go back and forth between this tab and that one, so that you
  can try what we discuss here.

  When you open that link, you should see something like this:

  <figure class="alt-layout-100">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Wikidata_query_service.png" />
    <figcaption class="image-credit">
      This is Wikidata's Query Service (WDQS).
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  Up at the top of the page there's a button labeled **Examples**. If you don't see
  it, click on the pie menu in the upper right. Clicking on **Examples** will give
  you access to a collection of sample queries that you can use to learn about
  SPARQL. For now, there's no need to master SPARQL; even very experienced
  Wikidatans just modify existing queries to find the information they want.

  Let's explore one of these examples together in the next slide.
