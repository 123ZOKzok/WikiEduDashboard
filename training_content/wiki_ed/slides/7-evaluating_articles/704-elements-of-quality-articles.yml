content: |
  The best articles share certain qualities, which can serve as a model for you
  to strive for in your own work:

  * A clear, easy-to-understand lead section, that is, the overview at the start
  of the article.
  * A clear structure with several headings and subheadings arranged
  chronologically or by themes, with images or diagrams when appropriate.
  * Balanced coverage of many aspects of the subject, with more important
  viewpoints getting more prominence in the article.
  * Neutral coverage, written without bias toward a particular point of view,
  and representing disagreements according to their representation in reliable
  sources.
  * Reliable sources are used throughout the article. For example, references to
  NASA rather than relying on an amateur's blog for information about Mars.
