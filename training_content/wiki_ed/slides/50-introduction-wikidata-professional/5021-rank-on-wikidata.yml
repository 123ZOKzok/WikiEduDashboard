  The final element in Wikidata is **rank**. Ranks allow for setting a preference
  among multiple values that apply to the same property. You would use ranks for
  changes in population, updated statistics about an item, or if there is
  conflicting data about an item. Wikidata expresses *preferred rank* with the up
  arrow, as you can see in the image above. The middle circle indicates *normal rank*
  and the down arrow means *deprecated rank*. The preferred rank for life
  expectancy of Uruguay is from 2016, the most recent data, although Wikidata
  has values for life expectancy from as far back as 1999.
