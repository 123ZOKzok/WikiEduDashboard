      ==Selca==

      Where is the difference between a selfie and a selca? Is there any? Maybe selca is just the term used in Asia but one thing is for sure, its origin is Korea.<br />

      == history ==

      *Ah, i had this watchlisted for its eventual creation.  I think it could be improved with additional sources, not just the few which have all been generated since April 1, 2013.  A "history" of the term would also be nice, I may try to help on that.  When I looked a few months ago, it appears the term arose around 2007-08, probably in Britain, as American-born slang words generally don't end with the "-ie" ending that you see in British slang like "telly" for television (surely someone knows what that tendency of form is called?).--'''[[User:Milowent|Milowent]]''' â€¢ <small><sup style="position:relative">[[Special:Contributions/Milowent|has]]<span style="position:relative;bottom:-2.0ex;left:-3.2ex;*left:-5.5ex;">[[User talk:Milowent|spoken]]</span></sup></small> 12:55, 6 April 2013 (UTC)
      **Any links you have would be helpful. The best history I've found so far is from Know Your Meme: http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/selfie . That's probably a more reliable source than just about anything else on this topic, anyway. Oddly, there has been an utter explosion of articles about selfies just in the last two weeks or so (and I only found them after I happened to decide to write this article, at just the right time, it seems). Google News search for all of 2012 turns up hardly anything, and the same is true for 2011. The most useful sources I've been about to find so far just happen to all be very recent. --[[User:Ragesoss|ragesoss]] ([[User talk:Ragesoss|talk]]) 13:52, 6 April 2013 (UTC)
      **It's difficult to keep pace with colloquialisms as they develop. I've seen these referred to by posters in the U.S. as selfpics or selfpix as well. I'm not sure how much analysis something like this really needs, but go ahead and document it as best you can. -- [[User:Boteman|Boteman]] ([[User talk:Boteman|talk]]) 03:16, 16 April 2013 (UTC)
      ***I might open it up for expansion and work. The best I can add are some victorian/edwardian examples of these types of photographs and some reasons why they were made. If anyone would like to expound upon that, leading to the huge "selfie" boom of the late 2000s, please, please do so. ([[User:Tsukiakari|Tsukiakari]] ([[User talk:Tsukiakari|talk]]) 00:45, 29 August 2013 (UTC))
      ***please see my post on the first selfie. I really think that we need to foreground that the selfie is a unique phenomenon and that any comparison to previous forms of portraiture (classic or photographic) can be useful to understand formal (use of mirrors etc.) or functional (to convey or create identity) overlap, but they cannot explain away the selfie as a mere remediation of the photographic self-portrait.[[User:Crystal vibes|Crystal vibes]] ([[User talk:Crystal vibes|talk]]) 07:23, 22 September 2014 (UTC)
