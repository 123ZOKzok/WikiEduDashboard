                I'd like to thank you for participating in the Wikipedia Student Program during the
                #{link_to @campaign.title, "https://#{ENV['dashboard_url']}/campaigns/#{@campaign.slug}", class: 'link'} term.
              %p.paragraph
                Despite the challenges of the past term, you and your students were part of a cohort of #{@campaign.courses.count} courses
                whose #{@campaign.students.count} students contributed #{number_to_human @presenter.word_count, delimiter: ','} words to Wikipedia.
              %p.paragraph
                You can always refer back to your
                %a.link{href: "https://#{ENV['dashboard_url']}/courses/#{@course.slug}"} course page
                to review your students' work.

              %p.paragraph
                If you've taught more than one course with us, just go to
                %a.link{href: "https://#{ENV['dashboard_url']}/my_account"} your profile page
                to see your collective impact.

              %p.paragraph
                Wishing you a happy and healthy New Year.
