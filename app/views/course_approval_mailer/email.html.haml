                  Your application for a spot in our Wikipedia Student Program has been approved, and your

                  To get started with your Wikipedia assignment, please distribute the
                  following enrollment link to your students:
                %p.paragraph
                  %a.link{href: @enroll_link}= @enroll_link
                %p.paragraph
                  This link will enable your students to both create a Wikipedia account
                  and then enroll on your Dashboard course page. Once a student is
                  enrolled, you'll be able to use the Dashboard to track their progress
                  throughout the Wikipedia assignment.
                %p.paragraph
                  Please get your students onto the Dashboard early on so that students can
                  familiarize themselves with the Wikipedia assignment.
                %p.paragraph
                  In addition to myself, you'll be working with one of our Wikipedia Experts.
                  You can reach out to either of us using the "Get Help" button on your course
                  page.
